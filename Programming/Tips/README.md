## The mission

Have you ever been told that a good hygiene is important to avoid sickness? Well computers are much the same. If they are not well taken care of, they can catch viruses! This briefing will have you explore some of the **good practices** that constitute a sane **cyber hygiene**.

To do so **complete** this [quizz](https://www.isdecisions.com/user-security-awareness-game/) on your own, while **taking note** of what you learn along the way. Then do some more research about [password manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_manager), [social engineering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_engineering_%28security%29), [password strength](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_strength) and [phishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing). 

To guide you through your research try to answer the following questions:

- **What makes a password strong?**
	* Unpredictable passwords — long, that contain numbers and symbols.
	* The longer the password, the harder it is to crack. Consider a 12-	character password or longer.
	* Avoid names, places, and dictionary words.
	* Mix it up. Use variations on capitalization, spelling, numbers, and 	punctuation.

- **What are three good reasons to use a password manager?**

	* Password managers store your login information for all the websites you 	use and help you log into them automatically
	* They encrypt your password database with a master password.
	* You have the possibility to use unique passwords on every website. giving the possibility to use unpredictable, long and strong passwords.  	
	
- **What's a "_passwordless_" approach to security? What are its advantages?**
	
	Passwordless authentication is signing into a service without using a 	password. This is often done with certificates, security tokens, one-time 	passwords (OTPs) or biometrics. Passwordless authentication is generally 	considered more secure than using passwords.
	
	His advantages are that they are safer. passwordless authentication methods 	require the users to show that they have a possession factor or an inherence 	factor in gaining access to a system or application. These two factors are 	more complex to circumvent than a password.



- **What's phising and how to prevent it?**
	
	Phishing are counterfeit communications that appear to come from a trustworthy source but which can compromise all types of data sources.
	
	_How to prevent it_
	* Verify before you click
	* Avoid unknown senders.Check names and email addresses before responding.
	* Don’t trust links or attachments in unsolicited emails.
	* When receiving email from known institutions (government,banks, your doctor), go directly to the source instead of clicking on links in the email.
	* Don’t give a stranger or unsolicited help access to your computer.
	* The most important in my opinion is be aware about all this techniques , _Knowledge is Power_
	
- **How could one prevent social engineering?**

	* Education : Ignorance is the primary reason people fall victim to Social Engineering attacks. Organizations and particulars should implement security awareness about how to respond to common breach attempts.
	* Establish Security Policies
	* Scrutinize All Information
	* Establish Security Protocols
	* Test Attack Resilience 
	
- **What are five bad practices when it comes to digital security?**
	* Outdated Software : TIP: Constantly Update.
	* Not Understanding the Threat: TIP: Educate Yourself
	* Lack of Proper Protection: Buy Reliable Security Programs
	* Evolving Software : TIP: Always Keep Anti-Malware and Other Apps Current
	* Carelessness through Email: TIP: Be Wary of Unsolicited Email

- **What constitutes, in your opinion, a good cyber hygiene?**
	
	In my opinion a good cyber hygiene is having a set of good behaviors and
	good manners like daily routines, and checkups
	to make sure the organization's online health is in optimum condition.		
	And The Center for Internet Security (CIS) 	Controls for Effective Defense is a good place to start.

	The CIS Controls for Effective Defense can be broken up into three 
	groups:

   	Basic CIS Controls
    Foundational CIS Controls
    Organization CIS Controls
				

> **NOTE**: We'll all get back together **to discuss your answers**, **findings** and **opinions** at the end of the challenge.

## Congrats

There is far more to **cyber hygiene** than what has been seen during this briefing, but hopefully it will have opened your mind to the fact that **you are the primary actor** of your digital security and although you cannot prevent all risks, **being informed** is a first step. In other words, stay informed, stay clean, stay safe, be happy!
