After Homebrew was installed, you can install the requirements using:

```bash
brew tap sidneys/homebrew
brew install cabextract wimlib cdrtools sidneys/homebrew/chntpw
```

chntpw is a software utility for resetting or blanking local passwords used by Windows NT operating systems on Linux. It does this by editing the SAM database where Windows stores password hashes.
