## Setoolkit

I read this article to have a little idea about how it works [Phishing Attack](https://www.cybervie.com/blog/phishing-attack-using-kali-linux/)

Gathered a few information about the setoolkit.

## Troubleshooting

Tried with setoolkit but didn't work the SMTP service.  

So I finally sent it via Sendinblue, Not ideal because  too much personal information like your mobile phone etc...
